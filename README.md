In the current digital era, improving traffic safety is a top priority. Speed control is one of the most effective measures to prevent accidents and traffic violations. However, effective monitoring and speed warning systems require intelligent and accurate solutions.

Using the YOLOv8 model to detect speed limit signs is an advanced approach to this issue. YOLOv8, with its fast and accurate object detection capabilities, can recognize speed limit signs from video footage and provide timely warnings if speed exceeds the allowed limit.

Integrating YOLOv8 into a Qt-based application requires synchronization between the detection modules and user interface. The system must process video in real-time, accurately detect speed signs, and issue timely warnings while providing a user-friendly interface.

This research focuses on developing an efficient speed control application using YOLOv8 and Qt for detecting speed limit signs and issuing alerts when violations occur. It will explore optimizing YOLOv8's performance in the Qt environment and developing an appropriate user interface.
